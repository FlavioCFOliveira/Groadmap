# SPEC — Groadmap Technical Specification

This directory contains the authoritative technical specification for Groadmap. The Specification First Policy applies: no implementation without a corresponding SPEC entry. See `CLAUDE.md` (project root) for the policy in full.

The SPEC is unversioned. Git is the source of truth for its evolution — recover any past state via `git log` and `git show`.

## 3. Canonical Sources

To prevent drift across SPEC files, the following topics have a single authoritative source. Other SPEC files MUST link to the canonical source rather than duplicate its content.

| Topic | Canonical Source |
|-------|------------------|
| Exit codes (numeric values and sentinel names) | `ARCHITECTURE.md § Exit Codes` |
| Sentinel errors and wrapping rules | `ARCHITECTURE.md § Error Handling` |
| Enums (`TaskType`, `TaskStatus`, `SprintStatus`) | `MODELS.md § Enums` |
| Memory layout / struct field ordering | `MODELS.md § Memory Layout Optimization` |
| Task state transitions | `STATE_MACHINE.md § Task State Machine` |
| Sprint state transitions | `STATE_MACHINE.md § Sprint State Machine` |
| Audit operations catalogue | `DATABASE.md § audit Table` |
| SQL DDL (table definitions, indexes, constraints) | `DATABASE.md` |
| Schema migrations | `VERSION.md § Migrations` |
| Concurrency model (WAL, pool, retry) | `IMPLEMENTATION.md § Concurrency Model` |
| Caching strategies (query, connection) | `IMPLEMENTATION.md` |
| Knowledge graph feature, persistence layout, guard rails, multi-layer conventions | `GRAPH.md` |
| Read-only web interface (server behaviour, routes, pages, security model) | `WEB.md` |
| Graph store directory (`graph/` subdir) | `GRAPH.md § Persistence Layout` (layout referenced from `ARCHITECTURE.md § Directory Structure`) |
| Graph query result JSON and property-type mapping | `DATA_FORMATS.md § Graph Query Result` |
| Web graph view-data JSON shape | `DATA_FORMATS.md § Graph View Data` |
| Web UI framework (Tabler admin shell, dark theme) | `WEB.md § UI Framework` |
| Vendored web assets / embedded Tabler framework and D3.js (with d3-sankey) | `BUILD.md § Vendored Web Assets` |
| Graph store concurrency / single-writer / recovery | `IMPLEMENTATION.md § Graph Store Concurrency` |
| Minimum Go version and external dependencies | `BUILD.md § Go Toolchain` |
| Help text canonical | code in `internal/commands/*.go` (structure in `HELP.md`) |
| AI agent contract JSON schema | `DATA_FORMATS.md § AI Agent Contract` |
| AI agent contract generation rules | `ARCHITECTURE.md § AI Agent Contract Generation` |

`DATABASE.md` additionally retains `CHECK` constraints in DDL as a normative reproduction of the enums; the Go-level enum definitions remain in `MODELS.md`.

## 4. Global Conventions

### Dates and Timestamps

- All dates and timestamps use ISO 8601 with UTC timezone.
- Format example: `2026-05-12T14:30:00Z`.
- This applies to: database columns, JSON output, audit log entries, version metadata.

### Process Output

- Successful command output: JSON to stdout.
- Error messages, help text, usage hints: plain text to stderr.
- Exit code conveys outcome class (canonical list in `ARCHITECTURE.md`).

### Filesystem

- Roadmap data directory: `~/.roadmaps/` with permissions `0700`.
- Per-roadmap home directory: `~/.roadmaps/<name>/` with permissions `0700`. The directory name is the roadmap name and is the container for all files the application uses for that roadmap.
- Individual roadmap databases: `~/.roadmaps/<name>/project.db` with permissions `0600`, created with mode `0600` from the outset (no umask-derived window). The SQLite sidecars `project.db-wal` and `project.db-shm` live alongside and use the same `0600` permissions.
- Neither the data directory nor any roadmap home directory may be a symbolic link; `rmp` refuses to follow a symlink when creating, opening, or migrating a roadmap directory (CWE-59). See `ARCHITECTURE.md § Directory Structure` and `ARCHITECTURE.md § Security Guarantees`.
- Per-roadmap knowledge graph store: `~/.roadmaps/<name>/graph/` (a directory) with permissions `0700`, created on first use of the `graph` command. See `GRAPH.md § Persistence Layout`.
- Roadmaps in the legacy `~/.roadmaps/<name>.db` layout are migrated automatically to the current layout at startup. See `ARCHITECTURE.md § Filesystem Layout Migration`.

### Naming Conventions

- Database columns: `snake_case` (e.g., `created_at`, `functional_requirements`).
- Go structs and fields: `PascalCase` for exported, `camelCase` for unexported.
- CLI commands and flags: lowercase, kebab-case (e.g., `task list`, `--max-tasks`).
- Short flags: single dash, may exceed one character when an unambiguous abbreviation is more readable (e.g., `-fr` for `--functional-requirements`).
